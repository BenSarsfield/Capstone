## Project Overview

An individual project where I chose my own task. I decided to construct a movie recommendation system using a synthetic data set from Kaggle and Python. The final deliverable was a presentation. 

## Files in Repository

Full complete Python code with function that takes in a movie title as an input and outputs 5 films the model deems to be most similar.

The final presentation detailing the steps I took in completing my project as well as some interesting insights I discovered in the data.
